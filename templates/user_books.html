<!-- Make an html page which allows 
 users to see favorited books, books 
 currently on hold, and books on hold in past.
 Should learn javascript first. Concepts: localStorage, async/await, DOM.
 We will make a short project with html, css, and javscript. It will add
 cards to a screen using an api and we will save it in localStorage. We will
 use the axios library to make calls. -->
